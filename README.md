# WentureFence

Test project for creating fences by spawning in parts and adjusting their angle and length.

Current features: add new fences, delete fences, update fences, switch camera (overview and follow-the-path).

# How to use
## In web:
Use [WentureFence_React](https://github.com/Timo654/WentureFence_React) instead.

## In editor:
Use Unity 2022.3.46f1 (older/newer versions may work, but are untested).
There is no Unity UI for it, so you'll have to manually add Fences to the "Fence Builder" script in MainScene -> Fencer. 
You can press H to redraw the fence.
